### 🧩 Overview  
The **E-Commerce System** is a fully object-oriented console-based shopping platform built in **C# (.NET)**.  
It demonstrates professional software architecture principles — including **Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction**, and full **SOLID compliance** — while simulating a real-world online shop environment.

The project includes modules for **user management**, **product catalog**, **cart handling**, **checkout process**, and **payment simulation** using both credit card and cash methods.

### 🎗️ System Architecture  

**Layered Design Pattern (3-Tier + Repository):**
| Layer | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| **Core (Entities + Interfaces)** | Domain models and business contracts (Product, Category, Customer, Order, etc.) |
| **Infrastructure** | Data persistence and repository implementation using a `FakeDbContext` |
| **Services (Business Layer)** | Business logic, validation, and rule enforcement |
| **Presentation (Console UI)** | User interface handling and navigation menus |

**Applied Principles:**
- ✅ **OOP Concepts:** Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Abstraction  
- ✅ **SOLID Principles:**  
  - Single Responsibility (each class handles one job)  
  - Open/Closed (services extendable for new features)  
  - Liskov Substitution (base–derived class structure)  
  - Interface Segregation (specific interfaces per repository type)  
  - Dependency Inversion (services depend on abstractions, not implementations)

### ⚙️ Core Features  

#### 🧑‍💻 User Management
- Register new customers with full data validation  
- Login system with email/password authentication  
- Prevents duplicate email registration  
- Password policy (min. 6 chars, must include letters & numbers)  

#### 🛍️ Product Catalog
- Displays categorized products (Electronics, Clothing, etc.)  
- Dynamic product listing with stock quantity tracking  

#### 🛍️ Cart Management
- Add / remove products with quantity validation  
- Prevent adding unavailable stock  
- Auto-updates total price and stock after checkout  

#### 💳 Checkout & Payment
- Two payment methods:
  1. Credit Card  
  2. Cash on Delivery  
- Validates card number (16 digits), expiry (MM/YY), CVV (3 digits)  
- Simulates order confirmation and payment success/failure  

#### 📦 Orders
- View all past orders per customer  
- Cancel order functionality  
- Automatic cart clearing after successful checkout

### 🧠 Highlights  

- 🔹 **Repository Pattern:** clean separation between data access and business logic  
- 🔹 **Dependency Injection-ready** architecture  
- 🔹 **Console-based UI** designed for clarity and step-by-step navigation  
- 🔹 **Safe input handling** via centralized helper class (`InputHelper`)  
- 🔹 **FakeDbContext** acts as in-memory database for testing
